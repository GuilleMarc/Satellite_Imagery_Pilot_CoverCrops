# Satellite_Imagery_Pilot_CoverCrops
Pilot project to track winter cereals growth based on satellite generated vegetation data.
Analytics workflow for the reflectance data from Venus imagery (11 bands, 30 m. resolution) analyzed for rye and wheat fields at the BARC station, and obtained at different dates in fall-spring (2018-2019). Additionally, selected rye and wheat fields were sampled for biomass at a single date (April 30, 2019).
•	Could we use a selection of vegetative indices in advance to characterize rye biomass?
•	Could we use mean and variance of selected indices to define areas of high/low productivity and stability?
